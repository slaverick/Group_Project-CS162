//getChar is a function to get a character from the user -Scott
//valChar is a function to validate whether a char is the requested char type, it calls getChar -Scott

//Hey guys, I separated the Tool and Rock files into hpp and cpp files. 


//FYI - I have not actually tested the Classes in a coding environment, nor have I testen the getChar or valChar code yet. I will //double check them tonight, I think, and resubmit them as full .hpp and .cpp files. (I'm doing school at work, but can't use //outside programs, etc.) - Scott
