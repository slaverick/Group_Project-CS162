//Group Project for Rock Paper Scissors game

//getChar is a function to get a character from the user -Scott
//valChar is a function to validate whether a char is the requested char type, it calls getChar -Scott

//Hey guys, I separated the Tool and Rock files into hpp and cpp files. 


//FYI - I have not actually tested the Classes in a coding environment, nor have I testen the getChar or valChar code yet. I will //double check them tonight, I think, and resubmit them as full .hpp and .cpp files. (I'm doing school at work, but can't use //outside programs, etc.) - Scott

//Hey Scott, I tested the Tool and Rock code, and got some compilation errors so I fixed them and separated them and re uploaded them. The Tool.hpp, Tool.cpp, Rock.hpp and Rock.cpp have all been tested. I need to add the enum and return, but so far, they compile correctly. I tested a Rock vs. Rock and it returned a 0 (since it would be a draw, should return a false). Once the enum and returns are changed, the Scissors and Paper should be super easy. Thanks for the code, it was a great foundation for me to work off of =D. -Esther
